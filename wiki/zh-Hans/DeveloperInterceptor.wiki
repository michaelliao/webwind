#summary Using Interceptor

= Using Interceptor =

Interceptors are like Servlet Filters somehow, but they are managed by IoC 
container. WebWind will get all interceptors from IoC container automatically. 
Interceptor can be used to do transaction, logging, and other things.

It is easy to define an interceptor:

{{{
import org.expressme.webwind.*;

@InterceptorOrder(0)
public class PerformanceInterceptor implements Interceptor {
    public void intercept(Execution execution, InterceptorChain chain) throws Exception {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            chain.doInterceptor(execution);
        }
        finally {
            long last = System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
            System.out.println("Execute " + last + " ms for URL: " + execution.request.getRequestURI());
        }
    }
}
}}}

But don't forget to call `chain.doInterceptor(execution)`, otherwise the process 
of HTTP request cannot be continued to next interceptor and the method which 
handles URL.

More than one interceptors are linked as a chain. `@InterceptorOrder` is used to 
specify the orders of interceptors. The lower value has higher priority.
